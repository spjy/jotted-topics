# Energy Quantization

In quantum mechanics, a photon's energy is released in discrete packets of energy called quanta.

It is characterized by the equation:

$$E = hv = \frac{hc}{v}$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| $E$    | Energy of quanta |
| $h$    | Planck's Constant $6.626 \cdot 10^{-34} J \cdot s$ |
| v      | Frequency of radiation |

### Maximum Kinetic Energy of Photoelectron

$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = hv - \phi = hv - hv_0$$
$$v \geq v_0$$

$$\phi = h v_0$$

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| $K$    | Max kinetic energy of photoelectron |
| $\phi$ | Work Function |
| v      | Frequency of radiation |

$\phi = hv_0$ is the minimum energy required to move an electron from the surface of a certain material. 

# Wave-Particle Duality

$$p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$$

# Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is especially useful for very small particles. It says that simultaneous measurements of two values has some error attached to it because of the scale.

$$\hbar = \frac{h}{2 \pi}$$

$$\Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar$$

$$\Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar$$

# Schrodinger's Wave Equation

$$- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \cdot \frac{\partial^2 \psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \psi(x, t) = j \hbar \frac{\partial \psi (x,t)}{\partial t} $$
