# Probabilistic Models

### Sample Space ($\Omega$)

The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

# Probability Axioms

### Non-negativity

For each event $A$, $P(A) \geq 0$.

### Additivity

If the sets $A$ and $B$ are [disjoint](/sets/#disjoint) events, then:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

### Normalization

The probability of the [sample space](#sample-space-omega) is equal to $1$.

$$P(\Omega) = 1$$
