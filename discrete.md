# Basics of Math

### Variables

Variables are a placeholder for an unknown value to generalize it.

### Mathematical Statements

| Type        | Description                     | Example           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Universal   | True for all elements in a set. | "For all ..."     |
| Conditional | True under a constraint.        | "If ... then ..." |
| Existential | True for at least one element.  | "There is a ..."  |

# Set Notation

A set is a collection of elements.

### Set Roster Notation

$$S = \left\{ x, y, z \right\}$$

### Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning      | Example   |
| ------ | ------------ | --------- |
| $\in$  | in           | $x \in S$ - "$x$ is an element of $S$" |
| $\dots$| and so forth | $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, ... \right\}$ - "Set of all positive integers" |
| $\mathbb{R} \text{}$ | Set of all real numbers | - |
| $\mathbb{Z} \text{}$ | Set of all integers | - |
| $\mathbb{Q} \text{}$ | Set of all rational numbers, quotients of integers | - |

### Axiom of Extension

A set is defined by its elements, not its element's order or frequency.

### Set Builder Notation

Set builder notation is a shorthand method to describe a set's elements. We can write it like:

| Notation                                     | Translation |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| $\left\{ x \in S \mid P(x) \right\} \text{}$ | The set of all elements $x$ in $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true. | 

For instance, these two sets are equivilent:

$$\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 10 \le x \le 15 \right\} = \left\{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 \right\}$$

### Subset

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If $A$ is a **subset** of $B$, or $A \subseteq B$, then each element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

| Notation         | Translation |
------------------ | ----------- |
| $A \subseteq B$  | $\forall$ elements $x$, if $x \in A$ then $x \in B$. | 
| $A \subsetneq B$ | There is at least one element $x \mid x \in A, x \not\in B$ |

#### Subset Example

Let's say $A$ and $B$ are sets.

$$A = \left\{ 1,2,3 \right\}$$
$$B = \left\{ 1,2,3,4 \right\}$$

$A \subseteq B$ because each element $x$ (1, 2 and 3) in $A$ exists in $B$.

#### Non-Subset Example

Let's say $A$ and $B$ are sets.

$$A = \left\{ 1,2,3 \right\}$$
$$B = \left\{ 1,2,4 \right\}$$

$A \subsetneq B$ because the element $3$ in $A$ does not exist in $B$.
