# Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law quantifies the relationship between two electrically charged particles.

### Magnitude of Force

$$|F| = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$

- $q_1$ is the magnitude of the first charge.
- $q_2$ is the magnitude of the second charge.
- $k_e = 8.988 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2} \text{}$
- $r$ is the distance between the two charges.

### Force Vector

$$\bold{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\bold{r}_{21}|^2} \hat{\bold{r}}_{21} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|r_{21}|^2} \frac{\bold{r}_{21}}{|\bold{r}_{21}|}$$

- $q_1$ is the magnitude of the first charge.
- $q_2$ is the magnitude of the second charge.
- $k_e = 8.988 \times 10^9 N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2} \text{}$
- $r_{21}$ is the vector from $q_2$ to $q_1$.

# Electric Field

### Electric Field Intensity

$$\bold{E} = \frac{\bold{F}_2}{q} = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^2} \bold{r}$$
