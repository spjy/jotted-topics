# Set

A set is a collection of objects. It has the notation:


### Elements

Elements are the objects within the set.

### In

The $\in$ symbol denotes whether an element is in the set.

#### In Example

Let $x$ be an element of the set $S$. This means:

$$x \in S$$

If $x$ was not in $S$, then it would be denoted as:

$$x \not\in S$$

### Empty Set

If the set $S$ is empty, it is denoted as:

$$S = \emptyset$$

### Finite Set Notation

$$S = \left\{x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n\right\}$$

### Infinite Set Notation

$$S = \left\{x_1, x_2, x_3, ...\right\}$$
